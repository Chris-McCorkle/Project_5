# Project_5

The project that I am currently working on as a part of my capstone experience involves python wrapping 
ISIS3 commands -- called 'nodes' -- and importing them into a workflow processing pipeline software,
which we used **Apache Airflow**. Along with this, we are implementing the add-on _Elyra_ which 
allows users to *drag-and-drop* the aforementioned nodes into working pipelines.
